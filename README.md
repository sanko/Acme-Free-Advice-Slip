# NAME

Acme::Free::Advice::Slip - Seek Advice from the Advice Slip API

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Acme::Free::Advice::Slip;
say advice( 224 )->{advice};
```

# DESCRIPTION

Acme::Free::Advice::Slip provides wisdom from [AdviceSlip.com](https://adviceslip.com/).

# METHODS

These functions may be imported by name or with the `:all` tag.

## `advice( [...] )`

```perl
my $slip = advice( ); # Random advice
my $slip = advice( 20 ); # Advice by ID
```

Seek advice.

You may request specific advice by ID.

Advice is provided as a hash reference containing the following keys:

- `advice`

    The sage advice you were looking for.

- `id`

    The advice's ID in case you'd like to request it again in the future.

## `search( ... )`

```perl
my @slips = search( 'time' );
```

Seek topical advice.

Advice is provided as a list of hash references containing the following keys:

- `advice`

    The sage advice you were looking for.

- `date`

    The date the wisdom was added to the database. It's in YYYY-MM-DD.

    I'm not sure why this isn't also returned when requesting advice by ID but that's how the backend works.

- `id`

    The advice's ID in case you'd like to request it again in the future.
